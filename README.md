# Phase noise compensation for 5G OFDM
The original PN compensation algorithm is proposed by Minkeun Chuang, a PhD candidate in Lund University. [Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8815523)
<br>
My work is to redesign the algorithm for hardware based on original software algorithm, exploring the software hardware co-design and achieve ultra-high through put and low latency.
