# Phase noise compensation for 5G OFDM
The original PN compensation algorithm is proposed by Minkeun Chuang, PhD candidate, Lund University in wireless communication. [Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8815523)

My work is to redesign the algorithm for hardware based on original software algorithm, exploring the software hardware co-design and achieve ultra-high through put and low latency.
